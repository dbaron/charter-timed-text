          Text Working Group</a>, part of the Video in the Web Activity, is to
        develop W3C Recommendations for media online captioning by developing
        and maintaining new versions of the Timed Text Markup Language (TTML)
        and WebVTT (Web Video Text Tracks) based on implementation experience
        and interoperability feedback, and the creation of semantic mappings
        between those languages.</p>

        <p>This group is chartered to develop formats used for the
          representation of text synchronized with other timed media, like audio
          and video. Such formats MUST be useable for online media captioning,
          should be useable for described video (aka video/audio description)
          and should address the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/media-accessibility-reqs/">Media
            Accessibility User Requirements</a>. Such formats MAY also be
          useable for broadcast production and exchange and MUST be useable in
          the context of HTML.</p>
        <p>The Group will:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Publish a Recommendation for a new <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml2/">Timed
              Text Markup Language (TTML) 2</a> specification. In the process of
            producing this new revision, the Group WILL:
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Address any issues found during the development of a Simple
                Delivery Profile for Closed Captions.</li>
              <li>Consider for adoption features from existing formats, such as
                CEA608 or CEA708, or developed by groups such as SMPTE, DECE and
                EBU.</li>
              <li>Seek backward compatibility with TTML 1 whenever possible.</li>
              <li>Will provide a mapping with HTML5/CSS3, including describing
                TTML intermediate synchronic document as HTML5 document
                fragment, and understanding how the presentation syntax and
                semantics relate to CSS3.</li>

        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/Charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal
            review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance,
          privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups,
          and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track
          document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#RecsWD"

            title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a> and at least 3 months
          before <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a>,
          and should be issued when major changes occur in a specification.</p>
        <p class="issue"><b>Issue:</b> The paragraph above replaces line-item
          liaisons and dependencies with individual horizontal groups. There's
          been a suggestion to name and individually link the specific
          horizontal groups inline, instead of pointing to a page that lists
          them.</p>
        <p class="issue"><b>Issue:</b> The requirement for an invitation to
          review after FPWD and before CR may seem a bit overly restrictive, but
          it only requires an invitation, not a review, a commitment to review,
          or even a response from the horizontal group. This compromise offers
          early notification without introducing a bottleneck.</p>
        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be
          made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#WGCharter">W3C

        <p> To be successful, this Working<i class="todo"></i> Group is expected
          to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including
          representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and
          active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs,
          specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half
          of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no
          minimum requirement for other Participants. </p>
        <p> The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public
          mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href="#communication">Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p> The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical
          submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the

        <h2> Communication </h2>
        <p id="public"> Technical discussions for this Working Group are
          conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>:
          the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will
          be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue
          tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and
          written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts
          of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may
          permit direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves
          are not open to public participation, however. </p>
        <p> Information about the group (including details about deliverables,
          issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available
          from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/">Timed Text
            Working Group home page</a>.<a href=""></a> </p>
        <p> Most <a href="https://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/">Timed Text Working
            Group</a> teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular
          specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis. </p>
        <p> This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public
          mailing list public-tt@w3.org (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-tt/">archive</a>)
          or <a class="todo" id="public-github" href="[link%20to%20Github%20repo]">GitHub
            issues</a>. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute
          to this work. </p>
        <p> The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list
          member-tt@w3.org (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/member-tt/">archive</a>)
          for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and
          members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases
          when a participant requests such a discussion. </p>
      </section>
      <section id="decisions">
        <h2> Decision Policy </h2>
        <p> This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due
          process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#Consensus">
            W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or
          other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in
          discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and
          consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p> However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but
          consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of
          views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a
          decision along with any objections. </p>
        <p> To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation,
          any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a
          face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.
          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for
          example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period
          from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation
          of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised on
          the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution
          will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working<i

            class="todo"></i> Group. </p>
        <p> All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless
          and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the
          discretion of the Chairs or the Director. </p>
        <p> This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C
            Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting
          procedures beyond what the Process Document requires. </p>
