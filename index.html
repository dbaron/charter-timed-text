          Text Working Group</a>, part of the Video in the Web Activity, is to

        <p>This group is chartered to develop formats used for the
          representation of text synchronized with other timed media, like audio
          and video. Such formats MUST be useable for online media captioning,
          should be useable for described video (aka video/audio description)
          and should address the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/media-accessibility-reqs/">Media Accessibility User Requirements</a>. Such formats MAY also be
          useable for broadcast production and exchange and MUST be useable in
          the context of HTML.</p>
        <p>The Group will:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Publish a Recommendation for a new Timed Text Markup Language
            (TTML) 2 specification. In the process of producing this new
            revision, the Group WILL:
            <ol type='a'>
              <li>Address any issues found during the development of a Simple
                Delivery Profile for Closed Captions.</li>
              <li>Consider for adoption features from existing formats, such as
                CEA608 or CEA708, or developed by groups such as SMPTE, DECE and
                EBU.</li>
              <li>Seek backward compatibility with TTML 1 whenever possible.</li>
              <li>Will provide a mapping with HTML5/CSS3, including describing
                TTML intermediate synchronic document as HTML5 document
                fragment, and understanding how the presentation syntax and
                semantics relate to CSS3.</li>
              <li>should address the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/media-accessibility-reqs/">Media Accessibility User Requirements</a>.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Publish a Recommendation for the WebVTT language, in particular
            the parts that cover the syntax, semantics, and rendering of
            subtitles, delivery of metadata, captions, chapter markers, and
            textual audio descriptions for speech synthesis. The Group is
            expected to produce annual updates for the Recommendation with
            previously unspecified features.
            <p>In the process of producing the specification, the Group WILL:</p>
            <ol type='a'>
              <li>Address any issues found in <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/text-tracks/raw-file/default/webvtt/webvtt.html">WebVTT:
                  The Web Video Text Tracks Format</a> produced by the Web Media
                Text Tracks Community Group. Some may be deferred to future
                versions. </li>
              <li>Include all features that have at least two independent and
                interoperable implementations.</li>
              <li>should address the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/media-accessibility-reqs/">Media Accessibility User Requirements</a>.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li> Establish a semantic mapping between TTML and WebVTT in order to
            facilitate browser implementation and market adoption. </li>
          <li>Maintain a simple constrained profile for delivery of closed
            captions for video content ("TTML Simple Delivery Profile for Closed Captions (US)") for TTML.</li>
          <li>Maintain TTML 1.</li>
          <li>Publish a text and an image profile of the Timed Text Markup
            Language (TTML) appropriate for worldwide subtitling applications,
            including dialog language translation, content description, captions
            for deaf and hard of hearing, etc., using <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/ttml-ww-profiles/">TTML
              Text and Image Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions</a>
            as basis. In the process of producing this profile the group WILL consider for adoption features from existing formats, such as CEA608 or CEA708, or developed by groups such as SMPTE, DECE and EBU.</li>
          <li>Produce a technical report (Note) on the application of TTML in
            live production and streaming such as for video content.</li>
          <li>Produce other technical reports (Notes) on aspects of TTML
                processing as appropriate.</li>
          <li>Produce a technical report (Note) on
          the <a href='https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/text-tracks/raw-file/default/608toVTT/608toVTT.html'>conversion
          of CEA-608/708 data streams to WebVTT</a>.</li>

        <p>The new work is expected to be broadly available and should be
          provided on a timely fashion. This charter features a tightly
          constrained scope designed to ensure that the Working Group will meet
          its schedule and objectives.</p>
        <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
        <p>The Working Group is expected to demonstrate at least two
          interoperable implementations of all available features in the
          recommendations. </p>

        <p>This group primarily conducts its work on the public mailing list
          public-tt@w3.org (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-tt/">archive</a>).</p>
        <p>A Member-only mailing list, member-tt@w3.org (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/member-tt/">archive</a>)
          is available for administrative purposes such as liaison with
          Member-only Working Groups. </p>
        <p>Information about the group (deliverables, participants, face-to-face
          meetings, teleconferences, etc.) is available from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/">Timed
            Text Working Group home page</a>.</p>

      <section class="decisions">
        <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>
        <p>As explained in the Process Document (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section
            3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus and with due process.</p>
        <p>
          The expectation is that typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required. However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs should put a question out for voting within the group (allowing for remote asynchronous participation -- using, for example, email and/or web-based survey techniques) and record a decision, along with any objections. The matter should then be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available.
        </p>
        <p>
        Any Decision taken is to be considered provisional for 10 working days after it has been recorded by the Chair and sent to the working group's mailing list. If no new objections are raised within that period, the decision will be closed. Decisions may be reopened by the Chair according to the Process Document if there is new information.
        </p>
          <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">Section
3.4,
            Votes</a> of the W3C Process Document and includes no voting
          procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.</p>
